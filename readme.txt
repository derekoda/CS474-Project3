Project 3

This is a readme file for Project3

To run the program, nagivate to the directory where the Project3.c is located.

Type 'make' into the terminal. This will create a file called a.exe

To run the executable, type ./a.exe

Running the executable as-is will run the program with the default values for N size (100), Thread count (1), and values in matrix (random)

The flag for setting N will be -s. For example, if you want to set N to 50, run the executable as such: ./a.exe -s 50

The flag for setting T will be -t. For example, if you want to set T to 2, run the executable as such: ./a.exe -t 2

The flag for setting V will be -v. For example, if you want to set V to 10, run the executable as such: ./a.exe -v 10

Setting the flags all together would look like this: ./a.exe -s 50 -t 2 -v 10
